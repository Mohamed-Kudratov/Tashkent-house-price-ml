# Tashkent House Price Prediction

## 🏘️ Project Overview
This project predicts housing prices in Tashkent using real-world data and machine learning models. It showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using scikit-learn.

## 📑 Dataset
The dataset contains housing listings in Tashkent and includes features such as:
- number of rooms
- size (in m²)
- district
- floor information

## 🛠️ Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Custom feature engineering (e.g., floor ratio)
3. Machine Learning pipeline with Scikit-learn
4. Baseline and improved models (Linear Regression, RandomForest)

## 🧪 Results
- Model trained and evaluated
- `final_model.pkl` included for reuse

## 📦 Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add more advanced models (XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Add GUI (e.g., Streamlit app)
